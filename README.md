# cnx-searchresults
IBM Connections Customizer Search results enhancement.

This small app adds a simple "target=_blank" to all the results in the connections search results page.
<br/>Now I don't **loose** my search results any longer.

## Setup

For on premises just clone this repository to your customizer data directory and import the *search.json* to the Appregistry.

## Disclaimer

Use it on your own risk...

Tested with IBM Connections 6.0 CR2
